                    The vast majority of our meals are single serving and meant to feed an
                    average adult. We also offer multi-serve proteins and sides, which are
                    designed to feed multiple people for extra mealtime flexibility. These
                    delicious, ready-to-heat options can help you bulk up existing meals,
                    simplify home cooking, or even build an entire meal from—the choice is
                    yours!

                    Our 6-meal plan is perfect for a person looking for 6 dinners (or
                    lunches!) a week. On average, our meals weigh in at about 13 ounces and
                    range from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger household, we do
                    offer a 12 meal per week subscription (it’s perfect for couples or a
                    family of 4 looking for 3 meals per week). Plus, you can always order
                    multiple subscriptions.

                    Our meals are chef prepared and delivered fresh, so typically they have
                    a refrigerated shelf life of about 3-5 days. Select items (such as
                    seafood) are best eaten first, so we’ll add a badge on the package to
                    let you know. We usually suggest enjoying these meals within the first
                    few days of receiving your order, but you can always check their exact
                    use-by date on the back-of-pack nutrition label. If you’re ever unable
                    to finish your meals within their shelf life, you can always pop them
                    into the freezer for extended storage. Just be sure to microwave your
                    meal straight from the freezer and add a few extra minutes to reach the
                    165° F internal temperature we recommend.

                    Your meals will come to you fully prepared so you just have to heat ‘em
                    up in the microwave. On the back of each meal, you’ll find our easy
                    steps for heating, but generally, the meals heat up in about 3 minutes
                    (depending on your microwave). If you’re unsure, start at 2 minutes and
                    heat in 30–second increments until the meal reaches an inner temperature
                    of 165° F. Our meals are packaged to be heated in the microwave (for the
                    ultimate convenience), but you can heat them in the oven if you’d like.
                    Just so you know, our current meal containers aren’t safe for the oven
                    or stovetop, so you’ll have to transfer your food to heat it up. You can
                    check out the full oven reheat directions in our FAQ.

                    To help guarantee your meals arrive in the freshest condition, there is
                    a small shipping fee associated with your order. We deliver to all
                    states within the continental U.S., and our shipping partners offer
                    delivery every day of the week. The exact days that we can reach you
                    will depend on your ZIP code and the carrier delivering your Freshly
                    meals. Whether you're signing up or updating your typical delivery day,
                    we'll show you all the days available to you so you can choose what's
                    best for you.

                    you'll pick the most convenient delivery day for you, and we'll ship
                    your chef-cooked meals right to your doorstep! If you ever need to skip
                    or cancel a week, it's easy to make changes to your upcoming delivery
