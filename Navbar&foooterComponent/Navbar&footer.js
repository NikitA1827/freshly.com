          The vast majority of our meals are single serving and meant to feed an
          average adult. We also offer multi-serve proteins and sides, which are
          designed to feed multiple people for extra mealtime flexibility. These
          delicious, ready-to-heat options can help you bulk up existing meals,
          simplify home cooking, or even build an entire meal from—the choice is
          yours!

          Our 6-meal plan is perfect for a person looking for 6 dinners (or
          lunches!) a week. On average, our meals weigh in at about 13 ounces and
          range from 300 to 650 calories. If you have a larger household, we do
          offer a 12 meal per week subscription (it’s perfect for couples or a
          family of 4 looking for 3 meals per week). Plus, you can always order
          multiple subscriptions.

      <div class="title">Do you accommodate dietary preferences?</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          We accommodate a variety of dietary preferences, including plenty of
          gluten-free certified, plant-based, and peanut-free options. As a
          customer, you can set your own dietary preferences and easily find the
          meals that work for you. You can also check out individual ingredient
          lists for each dish if you have specific concerns, or contact us at
          support@freshly.com for help making selections. If you’re unable to
          place an order that fits your preferences now, be sure to check back
          frequently as we’re always adding new and exciting dishes.

        <p>
          Our meals are chef prepared and delivered fresh, so typically they have
          a refrigerated shelf life of about 3-5 days. Select items (such as
          seafood) are best eaten first, so we’ll add a badge on the package to
          let you know. We usually suggest enjoying these meals within the first
          few days of receiving your order, but you can always check their exact
          use-by date on the back-of-pack nutrition label. If you’re ever unable
          to finish your meals within their shelf life, you can always pop them
          into the freezer for extended storage. Just be sure to microwave your
          meal straight from the freezer and add a few extra minutes to reach the
          165° F internal temperature we recommend.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Your meals will come to you fully prepared so you just have to heat ‘em
          up in the microwave. On the back of each meal, you’ll find our easy
          steps for heating, but generally, the meals heat up in about 3 minutes
          (depending on your microwave). If you’re unsure, start at 2 minutes and
          heat in 30–second increments until the meal reaches an inner temperature
          of 165° F. Our meals are packaged to be heated in the microwave (for the
          ultimate convenience), but you can heat them in the oven if you’d like.
          Just so you know, our current meal containers aren’t safe for the oven
          or stovetop, so you’ll have to transfer your food to heat it up. You can
          check out the full oven reheat directions in our FAQ.

      <div class="title">How does shipping work?</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          To help guarantee your meals arrive in the freshest condition, there is
          a small shipping fee associated with your order. We deliver to all
          states within the continental U.S., and our shipping partners offer
          delivery every day of the week. The exact days that we can reach you
          will depend on your ZIP code and the carrier delivering your Freshly
          meals. Whether you're signing up or updating your typical delivery day,
          we'll show you all the days available to you so you can choose what's
          best for you.

      <div class="title">How does the subscription work?</div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Every week you get to pick your selection of meals from our weekly
          rotation. Our meals cost as low as $8.99/meal, and come in five plan
          sizes: 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 meals per week. Once you select your plan,
          you'll pick the most convenient delivery day for you, and we'll ship
          your chef-cooked meals right to your doorstep! If you ever need to skip
          or cancel a week, it's easy to make changes to your upcoming delivery
          before the weekly deadline.
