                    <summary>I’m a new customer. How do I redeem my gift card?</summary>
                    <p>Redeem your Gift Card online at freshly.com/gifts. When redeemed and if the order amount is
                        greater than the amount on your gift card, your provided payment method will be charged for the
                        difference. If the gift card balance exceeds the amount of your order, your remaining gift card
                        balance will be converted to stored credit and automatically applied to future orders. If your
                        order amount and gift card have equal value, then the full gift card balance will be used on the
                        order. By using this card, you agree to these Terms & Conditions and Freshly reserves the right
                        to modify, replace, or suspend gift cards at any time. This Gift Card does not expire and is not
                        reloadable. No replacement if lost or stolen. Not valid on prior purchases, refer a friend
                        programs, applicable taxes, shipping fees or redeemable for cash or cash equivalents.</p>
